Sideshow driver compilation notes
---------------------------------

To compile this driver you need the Windows Vista WDK from http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/Devtools/wdk/default.mspx and the Windows SideShow Bitmap Driver source from http://www.codeplex.com/SideShowBitmap (version 1.0, revision 26610). 

The contents of the "NoDevice" folder replace the respective files in the Bitmap Driver "BitmapDriverSample" directory.

Run the "build" command from inside the "NoDevice" folder under a Windows Vista build environment.
